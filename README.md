## Overview of the Bikesharing Analysis: 
#### The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa is a great business proposal. With this analysis the clearer picture should convey the key stakeholders to move this business forward. This analysis will give the stakeholders an idea of the length of time bikes are checked out, show the number of bike trips for each hour of each day, show the number of bike trips for each type of user (customer/subscriber), and gender for each day of the week.

## Results from my Tableau Story:
- #### In this visualization we see the the trips start to hit 100k starting around 7am and keep at level or above that count until 8pm - 9pm. Maintenance on the bikes would be recommendable to be done between 12am - 5am.![NYC Citibike August Analysis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86431959/135735682-80336e92-7d33-49fe-a610-4e1623ea64af.png) 

- #### In this visualization we see males using more of the bikes. The females used about 25% overall during August, and less then 25% the gender was not indicated. With this information an impact to have a more marketing base towards females should be done to increase female useage of the bikes.![NYC Citibike August Analysis (7)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86431959/135767076-258ac560-969b-44b4-bce8-8db9eb0414c0.png)

- #### In this visualization it shows the number of bikes being checked out by all genders includeing the 'UNKNOWN'. The rides mainly last for about 10 minutes up to 15 minutes. Once the rides go past 15 minutes then the count of bikes being checked out start to decrease. ![NYC Citibike August Analysis (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86431959/135735747-e6f9f79e-1818-43e2-a800-3078d035da1d.png)

- #### This visualization shows Monday through Friday from 7am to 9am and from 5pm to 7pm there is a peak of trips. On the weekends starting from 11am to 6pm there is a peak of trips, especially from 11am to 12pm on Saturdays.![NYC Citibike August Analysis (8)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86431959/135768429-7aadccbe-93b7-4078-81f1-ad816c98d292.png)

- #### In this visualization we see that males tend to use the services at peak around 8am and between 5pm to 7pm during the weekday. During the weekends, it varies between Saturday and Sunday, but the usage of the bikes tends to pick up starting at 11am.![NYC Citibike August Analysis (9)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86431959/135768478-1a863765-0b90-4495-8cc0-1ef0bae0287d.png)

- #### In this visualization we see female and male subscribers have the most trips, or in other words use most of the services throughout the whole week compared to the other customers (usertype).![NYC Citibike August Analysis (10)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86431959/135768497-495c8a42-451a-4418-ac59-cdcd6708bbfa.png)
## Summary: 
#### In summary, the results provided within the data were very much in depth. From the hours of the day given to show the ride being executed to the gender of the individual riding in New York City, I think this data is very useful for when to give certain offers, when to do maintenance, and even how many bikes to have to lend to the people. Two additional visualizations I would perform with the given dataset are to analysis if the customers and subscribers stop during their ride to get drinks or other necessities. With this information parking stations for the bikes could be placed near certain stores or locations for all customers and subscribers for their necessities. Another additional visualization is the duration people stop during each ride. With this information the cost for each ride could be customized by the owners when making a change to make more profit for the business.
