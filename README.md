### Summary: 
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
#### Two additional visualizations I would perform with the given dataset are to analysis if the customers and subscribers stop during their ride to get drinks or other necessities. With this information parking stations for the bikes could be placed near certain stores or locations for all customers and subscribers for their necessities. Another additional visualization is the duration people stop during each ride. With this information the cost for each ride could be customized by the owners when making a change to make more profit for the business.
